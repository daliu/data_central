## Inspiration
I've always had a love for pokemon and a fond distaste for paying the bills.

## What it does
When you pay your bills with my app, you enter a pokemon fight with a random pokemon. You can use moves like "Payday", "Dig... out of the red zone", and "

## How I built it
I first established a webpage with Flask, then I implemented a webpage from which I could run Nessie API commands.

## Challenges I ran into
Figuring out how much I could accomplish within the limited time provided. Especially when determining how much "pokemon" I wanted to integrate.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I built the flask interface and have moved on to the python-api portion, hopefully, I can implement a working model with names soon.

## What I learned
I've learned a lot about Flask, which is awesome for general rapid prototyping. I also have learned a lot about Python modules and how to implement them.

## What's next for Pokemon Payments
I hope that pokemon payments can become a fully developed web application that brings young adults our age back to a nostalgic time, and takes the edge off paying the bills with exciting text and images.
